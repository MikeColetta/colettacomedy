## Project Description

My comedy website began using the start bootstrap template [Creative](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative) as a boilerplate. I've modified it to include a responsive calendar for my tourdates. I update those tourdates with simple JSON file. Future updates would include a contact form and maybe even a store page for merch.
